# ZenCord 
Originally developed by [Nevvulo](https://github.com/Nevvulo) by the name of `Peace of Mind`, this is a Powercord plugin that introduces Zen mode for Discord, similar to Visual Studio Code's Zen mode. It hides the server, channel, and members panels, as well as the Pin, Search, and Server Options bar. Just you and a text box.

Zen mode should work with any themes and plugins, as all it does is target actual Discord CSS. For example, I use a minimal discord theme and a messagebox-changing them with a lot of random plugins.

## Installation
Go to where you installed Powercord, denoted as <POWERCORD> (i.e. Desktop/Powercord) and enter the command
based on your system:

### Configuration
To configure the padding on the sides of the chat window, change the `$zen_padding` variable's percentage in `style.scss`. I recommend either 10% (default) or 15%.
### Unix (Linux, MacOS)

```sh	
cd <POWERCORD>/src/Powercord/plugins && git clone https://github.com/KryskZ09/zencord
```
### Windows
```sh
cd <POWERCORD>\src\Powercord\plugins && git clone https://github.com/KryskZ09/zencord
```

## Usage
**You can use `CTRL + ALT + [` to enable full zen mode, which looks like this:** ![](https://i.imgur.com/fhsWwQt.png) You can toggle it on/off using the same key combination.
